# Industrial Robotics

This project was part of my Industrial Robotics course, where I studied the movement and kinematics of robots. For Assignment 2, I simulated a Ping Pong robot. This robot is designed to train ping pong players, by repetitively hitting the ball in either edge shots or corner shots. This allows players to train in isolation more effectively.

The robot is made up of .ply files (using calculated DH parameters), and utilises singularity prevention, collision detection, and resolved motion rate control, and is controlled with the methods given by Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox.

To simulate, open the 'untitledGUI.m' GUI file.
