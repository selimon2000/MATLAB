# MATLAB
This is for  my industrial robotics assignment, where I simulated a ping pong robot. Using inverse kinematics, the ping pong robot hit the tennis ball, so it could train a player reacting to repetitive corner and edge table shots.

My robot comprised of a custom .ply model included singularity protection, collision detection, resolved motion rate control, visual servoing, and an e-stop.
