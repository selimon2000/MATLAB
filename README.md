# stand-in

This project was part of my Industrial Robotics course, where I simulated my Ping Pong robot. This robot is designed to train ping pong players, by repetitively hitting the ball in either edge shots or corner shots.

The robot is made up of .ply files (using calculated DH parameters), and utilises singularity prevention, collision detection, and resolved motion rate control. To simulate, open the 'untitledGUI.m' GUI file.
